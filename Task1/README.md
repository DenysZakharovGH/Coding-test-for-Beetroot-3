# Task 1 - Find value closest to zero

You're given a list of temperatures. Your job is to write a function that finds the temperature closest to zero in the 
list. You are also to write a test showing that your function works as expected.

If two temperatures are equally close to zero, return the positive temperature.

If the list is empty the function should return 0.

## Example:
```
Temperatures: [-1, 2, 4, 0.2, 5, 3, -2, -0.1]
```
Should return `-0.1`
